	For the implementation of the code I used Java language written in IntelliJ.

	I'm using 3 classes:
		- Karatsuba - using Karatsuba algorithm computes the multiplication between polynomials
		- Polynomial - The declaration of the polynomial
		- RunnableThread - Computes the actual multiplication
    In main there is declared a menu that allows the user to make his choice, how to compute the multiplication, by Karatsuba or with normal
multiplication. There are functions that allows the user to write the polynomials from keyboard, for generating random numbers.
    Polynomial class has as parameters the coefficients and the degree of the polynom.
    RunnableThread has as parameters 3 polynoms and the coefficient of the third polynom.
    Karatsuba has as parameters two polynoms, the coefficient and the nmber of threads allowed for use.
	To assure the syncronization of the code executed on the above steps, it was used "synchronized" method. After calling a method all threads are syncronized
and having the new matrix syncronized.

    Hardware used:
        - 8 GB RAM
        - Processor: IntelCore I7
        - 2.50 GHz
