	Done by Moldovan Alexandru-Vasile.
	
	I have declared a list of strings. The strings placed in the list are the pages from where the content is read.
	In the main function is initialized the pages list with some web pages url's and for each one it is created a Task that runns all of them with async and wait.
	
	There are created two methods:
		- DownloadPageAsync - has a string parameter, which is the page from where the content will be downloaded.
		- DownloadPageEvent - has a string parameter, which is the page from where the content will be downloaded.
		
	The method DownloadPageAsync creates a HTTPClient object, then a HttpResponseMessage objects calls for the client to get with async the page, it's content is handled
with an object HttpContent that gets it's content and as a final step, a string is declared which contains the content returnes as a string, read asyncrounous and then the result it's printed.
As a last thing, it's length will be printed.
	The method DownloadPageEvent creates a WebClient that calls a method named DownloadStringCompleted that has as parameter a sender and a second parameter that contains the result. 
The sender sends the result obtained from the WebClient in the result parameter and then it's printed using the method called Result used on the second parameter
