	For the implementation of the code I used Java language written in IntelliJ.

	I'm using the following classes:
		- Main
		- AppUtils
		- PC
    The application uses the Producer-Consumer method.
    AppUtils is has a method that generates a number between two bounds and returns that number.
    Main class has the following methods:
        - printList - prints a list of numbers
        - readInteger - read an integer from keyboard
        - runPC - runs the Producer-Consumer threads
    PC class is build of:
        - Constructor - gets as parameters: list of numbers, list of results of addition, the current pos from which we start to add, and
                        the number of elements to be added
        - runProducer - adds the needed amount of numbers and then notifies the runConsumer
        - runConsumer - after being notified by runProducer the consumer places the result in the list of results
	To assure the syncronization of the code executed on the above steps, it was used "synchronized" method. After calling a method all threads are syncronized
and having the new matrix syncronized.

    Hardware used:
        - 8 GB RAM
        - Processor: IntelCore I7
        - 2.50 GHz
