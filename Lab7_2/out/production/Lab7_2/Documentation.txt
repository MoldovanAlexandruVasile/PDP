	For the implementation of the code I used Java language written in IntelliJ.

	I'm using the following classes:
		- Main
		- BinaryTree
		- Node
		- RunnableThread

    Main class has the following methods:
        - readNumber - reads a string from keyboard
        - main - the main of the program

    BinaryTree class has the following methods:
        - Constructor - creates a binary tree with the first node being null
        - add - calls the addRecursive method
        - addRecursive - returns the current added node
        - traversLevelOrder - Traverse the binary tree in BNF order and starts the threads to compute the sum

    Node class has the following methods:
        - Constructor - constructs the node

    RunnableThread class implements Runnable and has the following methods:
        - Constructor
        - getRemainder - get the remainder of the class
        - setRemainder - sets the remainder of the class
        - run - computes the sum of the two digits from the same pos

    In main, there is read two numbers and the numbers are placed in two lists. The lower number is completed with zeros in its front to be of
the same size and a BinaryTree class is created. It is parsed from the last digit to the first and a RunnableThread is created and added to the
tree as a node.
	To assure the syncronization of the code executed on the above steps, it was used "synchronized" method. After calling a method all threads are syncronized
and having the new matrix syncronized.

    Hardware used:
        - 8 GB RAM
        - Processor: IntelCore I7
        - 2.50 GHz
